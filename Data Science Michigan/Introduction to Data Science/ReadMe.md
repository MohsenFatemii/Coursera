**Introduction To Data Science**

This is what i've done for `Introduction to Data Science` Course, the slides of the class, the files (for Example Week 1.ipynb) are the codes that written in the class.

if you want to open these `.ipynb` files you need to install jupyter using the following Command :

`pip install jupyter`

after installing jupyter all you need to do is to open Command Line(Or terminal) and go to the directory and open the document.

To open the document all you need to do is to enter the following command, for example i wanna open `week1.ipynb` :

`jupyter notebook week1.ipynb`

After running the following command the document will open. you can run the codes of each block using `Shift+Enter`

At last i need to apologize for my bad english
